# News Site

The task was to build a news site that contained a header (including name of the site), a logo, a navbar. The site was supposed to be structured using CSS grid and flexbox. The grid was supposed to be responsive depending on what device the user was using while viewing the website. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I decided to use the design sketch provided by Technigo as inspiration for my news website. In the end the design did not look exactly like the sketch. I sort of changed my mind whe I was working on the website, mostly because a lot of the tecniques were new to me. I decided to make the theme of the site true crime, since it's one of my hobbies. 

I started created the main structure of the website using CSS grid. I started by looking at the videos provided by Technigo, after that I started googling just in order to get some more advanced examples of the techniques thought in the videos. Inside the grids I used flexbox to structure the text and images. 

I wanted to create a mobile menu with a hamburger icon that was supposed to open when clicked on. At first I googled and found instructions at W3Schools. I got it to work but since I had constructed my website used grid it didn't really look that good. I found another instruction for mobile menu where JavaScript was used and I constructed my mobile menu acording to that one and got it to work. I wasn't familiar with some of the terms and elements and googled them and made sure that I was actually understood what the code was doing. I had to do a little reading on JavaScript. I may not fully grasp everything yet though. 

I had some trouble with the images, first on how to get them visible and then how to crop them. I hade written the image tag incorrectly and I did some googling and changed it so it was correct. At first I wanted the images do crop in a certain way when the screen width changed. I was able to do it a little bit using the object-fit property in CSS but not exactly in the way that I wanted. I decided to crop the images myself using Photshop so that all of them originally had the dimension 16:9. If I would have had more time I would have tried to figure out how to crop the images in squares as the width of the website changed. 

When I was building to website I had a tendency to code the HTML and CSS at the same time, which turned out to be a little problematic because it made the process a little more blurry. In hindsight I should have started with mainly the HTML and after that done the styling with CSS. But I think the reason was that I wanted to be able to see the changes that I did every step of the way and therefore I started to style the page at the same time. It's something that I will think of next time.
